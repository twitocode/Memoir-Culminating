I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didnâ€™t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
